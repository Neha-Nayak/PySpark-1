Smart India Hackathon
A solution for identification of news items and videos on the internet which are inimical to sovereignty of India.
ABSTRACT
Content available on various social media platforms include publisher of news and current affairs and online curated content. These contain anti-national elements which may be a threat to the sovereignty of India and disturbs public order. Hence, we have come up with a solution to identify this content and segregate it, so that the authorities can take further action.
Our approach to solve this issue comprises of three phases, namely, Crawling and Scraping, Analyzing, Analytics and Flagging.
Crawling and scraping comprises of Automatic web scraping (extract data from social media channels) all the web portals yield user-generated content Scrapped data can be exported to databases. Data scraped from social media, will be used in the next phase.
Analyzing include developing an ML Model to analyze data and track sentiment. It provides insights for current and upcoming threats. We will be using Reinforcement learning to better our ML algorithm to better predict and improve the accuracy of our model.
Analytics and Flagging is done to display the required information to the user by Implementing a web UI. It will display the content and its source as soon as it flags, which can later be removed by the authorities.
